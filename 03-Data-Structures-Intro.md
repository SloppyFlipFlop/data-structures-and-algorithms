# Data Structures: Introdution

## What is a Data Structure?

A Data Structure is a collection/arrangement of values, the vlues can have relationships among them and they can have functions applied to them. They are used to organize data in a way that makes it easier to work with.

## Understanding Data Structures

There are two parts to understanding data structures:

1. **How to Build One**

2. **How to Use it**

When bulding a data structure, we need to understand how a computer stores data. In order to a computer to run code, it needs to be able to keep track of things like variables(numbers, strings, arrays) and these variables are stored in RAM(random access memory) and when the computer turns off the memory is deleted. There is also stroage, where we can store video files and photos and is storaged on the computer permanently and is slower to access than RAM.

## Types of Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structures

- **Arrays**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees**
- **Tries**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**

### Algorithms

- **Sorting**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Breadth-First Search(BFS) + Depth-First Search(DFS) [Searching]**
- **Recursion**

### Different types of Data Structures in different languages

## What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?

- **Insertion** − Adds an element to the data structure.

- **Deletion** − Deletes an element from the data structure.

- **Traversal** − Accessing all the elements one by one so that it can be processed further.

- **Searching** − Accessing a particular element in the data structure.

- **Sorting** − Arranging the elements of the data structure in a particular order.

- **Access** − Accessing a particular element in the data structure.
